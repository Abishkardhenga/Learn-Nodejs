// we should write dev nodemone index.js and start node index.js because
//  when we write npm run dev it will run nodemon index.js  and when
//  we write npm start it will run node index.js so thats set not more 
//  complicated


//  about nodemon 

//  Nodemon is a command-line tool that helps with the speedy development of Node. js applications. It monitors your project directory and automatically restarts your node application when it detects any changes. This means that you do not have to stop and restart your applications in order for your changes to take effect.
